# 6.Write a function which takes in a studentâ€™s mark, and whether the work was submitted late from the user.
# The function will then output the grade depending on whether the work was submitted on time.
# If the work was submitted late, the student is capped at the pass mark of 40% (if the student hasnâ€™t reached 40% and is late,
# they get the mark they received for the work).
# Otherwise, the following grade boundaries are used:
#
# Mark Range	Grade
# A*	        80+
# A	            70-79
# B	            60-69
# C	            50-59
# D	            40-49
# F  	        0-39
